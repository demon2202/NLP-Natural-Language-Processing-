## Journey of NLP

### Early Beginnings

#### Alan Turing and the Turing Test
The journey of Natural Language Processing (NLP) begins with the pioneering work of Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist. In 1950, Turing published a seminal paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," in which he posed the question, "Can machines think?" He introduced the concept of the Turing Test, a method to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. The Turing Test implied the need for machines to understand and generate human language, laying the groundwork for NLP.

#### Rule-Based Systems (1950s-1960s)
In the early days of NLP, systems were predominantly rule-based. These systems relied on handcrafted grammatical rules and lexicons. The key focus was on syntactic analysisâ€”parsing sentences to understand their grammatical structure. Researchers like Noam Chomsky made significant contributions with his theory of transformational grammar, which influenced the development of syntactic parsers.

One of the first practical implementations was the Georgetown-IBM experiment in 1954, which demonstrated the automatic translation of over 60 Russian sentences into English. While promising, these early systems were limited by their reliance on manually created rules and could not handle the complexity and variability of natural language.

### The Advent of Statistical Methods

#### Shift to Statistical Models (1980s-1990s)
The 1980s and 1990s marked a paradigm shift from rule-based approaches to statistical methods. The increasing availability of digital text and advancements in computational power enabled the use of large datasets for training models. This era saw the rise of probabilistic models and machine learning algorithms in NLP.

#### Key Contributors
- **Frederick Jelinek:** A pioneer in applying statistical methods to language processing, Jelinek worked at IBM on speech recognition and machine translation. His famous quote, "Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up," highlights the shift from linguistic rules to statistical models.
- **Claude Shannon:** Known as the father of information theory, Shannon's work on the probabilistic modeling of language provided a theoretical foundation for statistical NLP.

#### Key Developments
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Techniques like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used to probabilistically determine the part of speech for each word in a sentence.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Systems were developed to identify and classify entities (e.g., names, dates) in text.
- **Machine Translation:** Statistical models, such as IBM's Model 1, were used to develop more effective machine translation systems.

### The Rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

#### Machine Learning Approaches (2000s)
The early 2000s saw the widespread adoption of machine learning techniques in NLP. Algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and naive Bayes classifiers became popular for various NLP tasks. The development of large annotated datasets, such as the Penn Treebank, facilitated the training of these models.

#### Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present)

# Example of NLP using Python

### Example: Sentiment Analysis using NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

class LogisticRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None

    def sigmoid(self, z):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

    def fit(self, X, y):
        num_samples, num_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(num_features)
        self.bias = 0

        # Gradient descent
        for _ in range(self.num_iterations):
            linear_model = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
            y_predicted = self.sigmoid(linear_model)

            # Compute gradients
            dw = (1 / num_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_predicted - y))
            db = (1 / num_samples) * np.sum(y_predicted - y)

            # Update parameters
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db

    def predict(self, X):
        linear_model = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
        y_predicted = self.sigmoid(linear_model)
        y_predicted_cls = [1 if i > 0.5 else 0 for i in y_predicted]
        return y_predicted_cls

# Toy dataset (Bag-of-Words representation)
X_train = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # "good movie"
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],  # "bad acting and boring"
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # "great film"
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # "terrible performance"
])

])
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```
##Explanation
Now, let's break down each line of code with detailed explanations:

```python
import numpy as np
```
- **Explanation:** This line imports the NumPy library, a powerful package for numerical computing in Python. It's commonly aliased as `np` for convenience.

```python
class LogisticRegression:
```
- **Explanation:** This line starts the definition of a Python class named `LogisticRegression`, which will contain methods for fitting the model and making predictions.

```python
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
```
- **Explanation:** This line defines the constructor method `__init__` for the `LogisticRegression` class. It initializes the logistic regression model with default values for the learning rate (`learning_rate`) and number of iterations (`num_iterations`). These parameters control the speed and convergence of the gradient descent optimization algorithm.

```python
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None
```
- **Explanation:** These lines initialize the attributes of the logistic regression model. `learning_rate` and `num_iterations` are set to the values passed to the constructor. `weights` and `bias` are initialized to `None` because they will be set during the training process.

```python
    def sigmoid(self, z):
```
- **Explanation:** This line defines a method named `sigmoid` within the `LogisticRegression` class. The sigmoid function is used to compute the sigmoid activation for logistic regression.

```python
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
```
- **Explanation:** This line implements the sigmoid function. Given an input `z`, it returns the output of the sigmoid function, which is defined as `1 / (1 + e^(-z))`, where `e` is Euler's number (approximately 2.718) and `np.exp()` calculates the exponential value.

```python
    def fit(self, X, y):
```
- **Explanation:** This line defines a method named `fit` within the `LogisticRegression` class. This method is responsible for training the logistic regression model on the input data `X` (features) and `y` (labels).

```python
        num_samples, num_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(num_features)
        self.bias = 0
```
- **Explanation:** These lines initialize the model parameters (`weights` and `bias`). `num_samples` and `num_features` represent the number of samples (rows) and features (columns) in the input data `X`. `np.zeros(num_features)` creates an array of zeros of length `num_features`, initializing the weights to zero. `self.bias` is initialized to zero.

```python
        for _ in range(self.num_iterations):
```
- **Explanation:** This line starts a loop that iterates `num_iterations` times. During each iteration, the model parameters will be updated based on the gradient descent optimization algorithm.

```python
            linear_model = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
            y_predicted = self.sigmoid(linear_model)
```
- **Explanation:** These lines compute the linear model (`linear_model`) by taking the dot product of the input data `X` and the weights, and then adding the bias. The sigmoid activation function is applied to the linear model to obtain the predicted probabilities (`y_predicted`).

```python
            dw = (1 / num_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_predicted - y))
            db = (1 / num_samples) * np.sum(y_predicted - y)
```
- **Explanation:** These lines compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters (`weights` and `bias`). `dw` represents the gradient of the weights, and `db` represents the gradient of the bias.

```python
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db
```
- **Explanation:** These lines update the model parameters (`weights` and `bias`) using the gradients computed in the previous step. The learning rate (`learning_rate`) controls the step size of the updates.

```python
    def predict(self, X):
```
- **Explanation:** This line defines a method named `predict` within the `LogisticRegression` class. This method is responsible for making predictions on new input data `X` based on the trained model.

```python
        linear_model = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
        y_predicted = self.sigmoid(linear_model)
        y_predicted_cls = [1 if i > 0.5 else 0 for i in y_predicted]
        return y_predicted_cls
```
- **Explanation:** These lines compute the linear model (`linear_model`) for the input data `X`, apply the sigmoid activation function to obtain predicted probabilities (`y_predicted`), and then convert the probabilities to binary class labels (`y_predicted_cls`) by thresholding at 0.5.

The remaining lines of code set up a toy dataset, initialize and train the logistic regression model, and make predictions on new test data.
